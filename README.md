<h1>
Deadlock Detection Using Banker's Algorithm</h1>
<br>
<div>This project implements a program in C++ that detects the possibility of a deadlock occurring for a set of incoming processes using the Banker's Algorithm. The program checks if the system is in a safe state or if a deadlock is possible, based on the resource allocation, maximum need, and available resources.</div>
<h1>Banker's Algorithm</h1>
<br>
<div>The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm. It tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of resources and makes an "s-state" check to test for possible activities before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.</div>
